# Java Newts 
---
## General
* Each `.java` file has a primary class that named after the file
* `.java` programs have at least one class and one `main()` method
    * the `main()` method runs the tasks of the program
* Java is a _compiled_ programming language
    * code written in a `.java` file is transformed into _byte code_ by a compiler before it is executed by the Java Virtual Machine into a language the computer can understand
    * compiling process catches errors before the compiler rus the code
    * programs are compiled using "javac ProgramName`.java`"
        * a successful compilation produces a `.class` file: ProgramName`.class`; which is executed with "java ProgramName" (the `.class` format is left off)
        * an unsuccessful complication produces errors and no `.class` file until the errors are corrected and the compiler is ran again

### Syntax
* Java does not interpret whitespace
* Java _does_ interpret semicolons
* Classes are writted using _pascal case_
* Methods and variables are written using _camel case_
